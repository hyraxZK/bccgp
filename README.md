# libbccgp - BCCGP-srqt and Bulletproofs implementations #

**Note**: this library is slower than optimized implementations of bulletproofs, notably
[dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs](https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/bulletproofs).
Please use that library when benchmarking Bulletproofs! (But you may find [libbccgp/pws.py](libbccgp/pws.py)
useful as a way of compiling circuits to the arithmetization that Bulletproofs requires.)

This library contains indepent re-implementations of the following two protocols:

[BCCGP-sqrt](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/263), from 
J. Bootle, A. Cerulli, P. Chaidos, J. Groth, and C. Petit.
"Efficient Zero-Knowledge Arguments for Arithmetic Circuits in the Discrete Log Setting".
EUROCRYPT, May 2016.

[Bulletproofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066), from
B. BÃ¼nz, J. Bootle, D. Boneh, A. Poelstra, and G. Maxwell.
"Bulletproofs: Short Proofs for Confidential Transactions and More".
IEEE S&P, May 2018.

In addition, it contains a compiler from (a subset of) PWS files to the constraint
format required by the above two systems.

This implementation is written in Python and C/C++. It is compatible with both Python 2.7
and PyPy. (Porting to Python 3.0 would be trivial, but would reduce performance.)

## Building and using ##

The code in this directory is pure Python, but for elliptic curve operations and
polynomial multiplication, we use C extensions. The EC extension lives in its own repository,
[pymiracl](https://github.com/hyraxZK/pymiracl).
The easiest way to use the whole system is to check out the
[hyraxZK](https://github.com/hyraxZK/hyraxZK) "meta-repository", which links all the necessary
submodules and has a top-level Makefile.

## Running ##

If you want to run a PWS file, you should use `run_fennel.py` like so:

    ./run_bccgp.py -p /path/to/PWS/file

Execute `./run_bccgp.py` with no arguments to see all of the possible arguments.
